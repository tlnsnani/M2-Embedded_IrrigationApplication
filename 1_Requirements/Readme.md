## Introduction
India is mainly an agricultural country. Agriculture is the most important occupation for the most of the Indian families. It plays vital role in the development of agricultural country. In India, agriculture contributes about 16% of total GDP and 10% of total exports. Water is main resource for Agriculture. Irrigation is one method to supply water but in some cases there will be lot of water wastage. So, in this regard to save water and time we have proposed project titled automatic irrigation system using IoT. In this proposed system we are using various sensors like temperature, humidity, soil moisture sensors which senses the various parameters of the soil and based on soil moisture value land gets automatically irrigated by ON/OFF of the motor.

## Features
* It can automatically senses the soil moisture.
* It reduces the motor ON time.
* It can automatically turns ON/OFF the motor by using an relay
 
## 4W's and 1'H
### Who
Easy to Access by the Gardeners,Farmers and Interested in Home Roof Gardeners.

### What
Implementation of Automatic Irrigation System.

### Where
It Can be Used at fields, gardens.

### When
At Any Time it can be Used if Neccesary After Bulid the Circuit.

### How
This Application is Implemented using C Embedded Programing language.

## SWOT ANALYSIS
### Strength
Highly Sensitive, Low Cost and Reliable Circuit.

Reducese ManPower.

Fully Automated Irrigation System Which Will Turn ON and OFF a Water Pump as Per the Level of Moisture in Soil.

Highly Sensitive,Low Cost and Reliable Circuit.


### Weakness
This requires some equipment like Atmega micro controller and some peripeherals

Requires 5V DC power supply for micro controller

### Opportunities
There are Huge Opportunities in the Local Market Since These Types of Automations are not yet Penetrated to the Villages and Rural Markets.

Agriculture Still uses Conventional Methods for Many Cases So that a Huge Opportunities are Still Awaiting in Rural India.

### Thearts
New Automatic Systems are to be Introduced to the Market Which may have Better Options.

Cheap Complementary Products May Enter to the Market.
